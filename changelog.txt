# Version 0.0.3, 2022-10-14
	- Added -U to force-remove unmapped reads from analysis.
		- This is mainly for trying to analyze paired-end BAMs where one mate may be mapped and the other is not.
		- Ultimately, advice would be to:
			- analyze mates separately if starting from Fastq.
			- use -N and -U if analyzing a pre-made position-sorted paired BAM
				- This will make some results "meaningless"
					- Completeness will arbitrarily be 100%
					- QVs adjusted for unmapped reads will be same as without adjusting them.
		- See known_issues #3 for more info.
